# Banknotes
Detecting forged banknotes

In this report we create a simple analysis to separate real and false banknotes using the K-Means clustering algorithm, based on the dataset available <a href='https://www.openml.org/d/1462'>here</a>.

This work is part of the final project requested by the course <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-k-means-clustering-python'>Foundations of Data Science: K-Means Clustering in Python</a>.
